I'm with you from Friday to MondayA slacker with no money, but I'm yours.I promise you that this is only temporary,I want you to be sure of me.Your parents don't like me,They're talking nonsense, they say I'll destroy you.Everybody says awful things, but it's only temporary,I want to impregnate you.
