I'm with you from Friday to Monday A slacker with no money, but I'm yours.
I promise you that this is only temporary, I want you to be sure of me.
Your parents don't like me, They're talking nonsense, they say I'll destroy you.
Everybody says awful things, but it's only temporary, I want to impregnate you.
My bride, you're my bride, And to be honest, I'm lucky to be with you.
My bride, you're my bride, I wonder if this is reality or a dream.
You're with me from Friday to Monday, You don't need to call my feelings a game.
Don't joke with that, because I'm serious, Go and tell your family, let the tears flow.
And with a white dress, you wore a veil, I saw it in your eyes, you wanted it.
And now my head's spinning, I want to.
